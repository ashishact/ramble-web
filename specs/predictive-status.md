The UI System Thinking shows nothing 
It says No system thinking yet - which is understandable because we haven't reached the number of knowledge items yet - but we would like to see some prediction like only 3 knowledge items 14 more required to run the system thinking - Make appropriate content. Also put a button when i click it can run the system thinking and replace if one exists for this run (16 items)

In the knowledge items I don't see any category or tags - let's show them - infact let's bg color the knowledge items with a very light tint of the category color

The session state ui is not reactive - i have to reload to see the changes.
