Always use pnpm.
Always explain what you are doing before doing it - don't simply do it.

Don't simplify or make something complex - I might be asking for a specific way because - that architecture is what will give evolution of future features.
Always look for dependency code - when you change a fn - check maybe UI has to be change - or somethere we might be using it with injection - always check.
